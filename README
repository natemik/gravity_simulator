This program uses ideal physics equations to calculate and graphically simulate
the actions of a free falling ball, based on user defined initial conditions.

In this program, a vector upwards is considered to be positive, and a vector
downwards is considered to be negative

This program utilizes "pygame", which must be installed on users computer
to ensure proper functionality of the the program

To Run:
  *In the proper directory in the command line, run the program using the
   command "python3 gravity.v2.py <INITIAL DISTANCE> <ACCELERATION> <INITIAL VELOCITY> "
   where <INITIAL DISTANCE> is the initial distance in meters from the ground
   to the ball. <ACCELERATION> is a constant acceleration for the program in
   meters per second squared, and <INITIAL VELOCITY> is the initial velocity of
   the ball in meters per second.

   *All three values must be present for the program to run properly

Included Files:
  *gravity.v2.py
  *README
